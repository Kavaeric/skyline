	<p>A mechanical engineer, an air force mechanic, and an avionics programmer are seated in the cockpit of a new prototype business jet. Flying high above the Earth, its engines roared through the sky.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the aeroplane entered a nosedive. All three began scrambling to diagnose the issue, and soon found a cause: One of the engines had suddenly stopped mid-flight, and the elevator controls had jammed. Somehow, though, the three manage to guide the aeroplane down to a safe landing on a remote airstrip. Relieved, they soon set out to find what had gone wrong.</p>

<p>"Give me some time," the engineer said, "it seemed like a fuel flow problem. I will have to remodel the fuel plumbing in the wings."</p>

<p>The mechanic spoke up next. "This is a small jet. I'll have a look at the tail elevator control surfaces. A bolt and nut had likely gotten loose in-flight."</p>

<p>"Well," the programmer spoke, "why don't we give it a run again, and see if it's reproducible?"</p>
